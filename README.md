# La-Casa-De-La-Fruta
(Our First Website)

Fake Scenario created by the team:

‘La Casa de La Fruta’ was a mango stall founded in 2000 by Charles Johnson where he sold freshly picked mangoes from his garden in Australia. As his business grew he started selling other fruits and vegetables. However, technology has become more advance over the years, causing profits to decrease as competition started rising. Charles shifted his store online, expanding his customer reach. Now, La Casa de La Fruta ships fresh fruits and vegetables from Australia to more that 30 countries around the world.
